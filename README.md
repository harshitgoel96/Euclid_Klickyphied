I was interested in buying Euclid Probe for my Voron Switchwire. but there was no easy way to use it with Switchwire. I created a dock that is compattible with [Euclid probe](https://euclidprobe.github.io/) and the [docking system](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe/tree/main/Printers/Voron/Switchwire) of [Klicky Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe).
